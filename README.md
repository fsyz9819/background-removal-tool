# 🎨 Background Removal Tool

A browser-based background removal application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to upload an image and remove the background either by **brush masking** or using a **color-based algorithm**.The idea came from a common marketing challenge—quickly creating clean visuals for campaigns without needing advanced design software. I prototyped it using Vibe Coding, designed the interface to be fast and user-friendly.
